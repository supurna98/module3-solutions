				<p>The chicken is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl . They are one of the most common and widespread 
				domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens 
				in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food and, less commonly, as pets.
				Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period.In the UK
				and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada,Australia
				and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.Castrated or neutered roosters are 
				called capons. Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet
				becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand ,there is a generic term chook to describe all
				ages and both sexes. The young are often called chicks.Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.</p>

			<p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.
			Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts,
			such as roasts, short ribs or steak ,while other cutsare processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually
			mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher)cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties 
			called blood sausage.Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones 
			are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves)is called veal.Beef from steers and heifers is similar.Depending on economics,
			the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince 
			(known as ground beef in the United States).Cattle raised for beef may be allowedto roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage 
			in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot .Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world.</p>

			<p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice , usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of 
			ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
			but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it 
			can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna 
			or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon 
			radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese 
			cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p>
